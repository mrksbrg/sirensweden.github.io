* SiREN meetings last lunch to lunch to facilitate travel the same days.

### How to prepare for SiREN Signal 2025?

* [Node representatives](../#node-representatives) are encouraged to involve any other colleagues (students, faculty, industry) who work with RE and may be interested to attend. Contact the [Signals PC Co-chairs](../#chairs-and-founders) on how to register participants and for any other information about the event.
* If you want to present, contact the organizers. We give priority to PhD students that want useful feedback from RE friends.
