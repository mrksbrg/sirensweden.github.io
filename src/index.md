*Network meeting coming up:* [**SiREN Signal 2026**](2026)

## About

* **SiREN** is a non-profit network of **academic scholars in Sweden** with a deep interest in **Requirements Engineering (RE) research and practice**.

* Our annual meetings focus on work by **PhD students** in Sweden with a thesis project in any way connected to requirements of software-based systems.

* We also invite research-oriented software engineering **practitioners** from Swedish industry with a deep interest in RE.

## Organisation

### Governance

1. Chairs and Node Representatives (NR) are voting members of the Steering Committee (SC).
2. Founders (F) and Industry Ambassadors (IA) are invited as non-voting participants at SC meetings. 
3. The SC decides about when and where the Signals (a.k.a. annual network meetings) take place.
4. The SC decides who is SC Chair (SCC) and Signals Program Chairs (SPC).
5. The SCC and SPC decide about who is invited and assigned as NR and IA.
6. The mandate period length is decided upon appointment, normally at least 2 years. Appointees can be reelected.
7. SC, F, NR, and IA nominates participants to Signals and SPC decides how many and whom to invite.

## Signals

We have since 2003 held annual network meetings aka Signals, where we exchange ideas and discuss any interesting topics related to requirements of software-based systems, including research, teaching and practice of RE. Signals are typically lunch to lunch at a university somewhere in Sweden. Everyone travel on their own budget and we aim at a minimal admin overhead.

## Forums

If you are doing software engineering research with a requirements engineering angle you are recommended to publish at these core forums:

* [**REJ**](https://link.springer.com/journal/766): Requirements Engineering, *journal*: (Springer-Nature), a high-impact journal with good reputation. Several SiREN members are in the [REJ Editorial Board](https://link.springer.com/journal/766/editorial-board).
* [**RE**](https://conf.researchr.org/series/RE): Requirements Engineering, *international conference*: (IEEE/ACM), a top-tier conference with focus on excellence.
* [**REFSQ**](https://refsq.org): Requirements Engineering Foundation for Software Engineering, *international working conference* (Springer LNCS), invites on-going work and novel research, you hear it first at REFSQ!
