5. The SC Chair and Signal Program Chairs decides about who is invited and assigned as NR and IA.
6. SC, F, NR, and IA invites participants to Signals.

## Signals

We have since 2003 held annual network meetings aka Signals, were we exchange ideas and discuss any interesting topics related to requirements of software-based systems, including research, teaching and practice of RE. Signals are typically lunch to lunch at a university somewhere in Sweden. Everyone travels on their own budget and we aim at a minimal admin overhead.

## Forums

If you are doing software engineering research with a requirements engineering angle you are recommended to publish at these core forums:

* [**REJ**](https://link.springer.com/journal/766): Requirements Engineering, *journal*: (Springer-Nature), a high-impact journal with good reputation.
* [**RE**](https://conf.researchr.org/series/RE): Requirements Engineering, *international conference*: (IEEE/ACM), a top-tier conference with a low acceptance rate.
* [**REFSQ**](https://refsq.org): Requirements Engineering Foundation for Software Engineering, *international working conference* (Springer LNCS), invites on-going work and novel research, you often hear it first at REFSQ!
