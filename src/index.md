## Swedish Requirements Engineering Network

![](siren-logo.png "SiREN logo")

* **SiREN** is a non-profit network of **academic scholars in Sweden** with a deep interest in **Requirements Engineering (RE) research and practice**.
* Our annual meetings focus on Swedish **PhD students** with a thesis project in any way connected to requirements of software-based systems.
* We also invite research-oriented software engineering **practitioners** from Swedish industry with a deep interest in RE.

## Organisation

* Program co-chairs: [Assoc. Prof. Jennifer Horkoff](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/jenho/) and [Prof. Eric Knauss](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/knauss/)
* Steering-committee chair: [Prof. Björn Regnell](https://cs.lth.se/bjorn-regnell/)

## SiREN Signals

We have since 2003 held annual network meetings aka Signals, were we exchange ideas and discuss any interesting topics related to requirements of software-based systems, including research, teaching and practice of RE. Signals are typically lunch to lunch at a university somewhere in Sweden. Everyone travels on their own budget and we aim at a minimal admin overhead. 

* *COMING UP:* [**SiREN Signal 2025**](2025/index.html). Venue to be decided.
