### Governance

1. Chairs and Node Representatives (NR) are voting members of the Steering Committee (SC).
2. Founders (F) and Industry Ambassadors (IA) are invited as non-voting participants at SC meetings. 
3. The SC decides about when and where the Signals (a.k.a. annual network meetings) take place.
4. The SC decides who is SC Chair (SCC) and Signals Program Chairs (SPC).
5. The SCC and SPC decide about who is invited and assigned as NR and IA.
6. SC, F, NR, and IA nominates participants to Signals and SPC decides how many and whom to invite.

## Signals

We have since 2003 held annual network meetings aka Signals, were we exchange ideas and discuss any interesting topics related to requirements of software-based systems, including research, teaching and practice of RE. Signals are typically lunch to lunch at a university somewhere in Sweden. Everyone travels on their own budget and we aim at a minimal admin overhead.

## Forums

If you are doing software engineering research with a requirements engineering angle you are recommended to publish at these core forums:

* [**REJ**](https://link.springer.com/journal/766): Requirements Engineering, *journal*: (Springer-Nature), a high-impact journal with good reputation.
* [**RE**](https://conf.researchr.org/series/RE): Requirements Engineering, *international conference*: (IEEE/ACM), a top-tier conference with a low acceptance rate.
* [**REFSQ**](https://refsq.org): Requirements Engineering Foundation for Software Engineering, *international working conference* (Springer LNCS), invites on-going work and novel research, you often hear it first at REFSQ!
