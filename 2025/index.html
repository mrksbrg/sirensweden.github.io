Invitation email to node representatives from Co-chairs Jennifer Horkoff & Eric Knauss:
```
Hello SiREN colleagues,
 
Eric and I are stepping in to co-chair SiREN, thank you Richard for taking the role for a number of years!  We also have a revamped website, thank you Björn: https://sirensweden.github.io/#swedish-requirements-engineering-network

We’d like to try to organize a meeting this spring.
It will likely be at Lund or Gothenburg, depending on the numbers that can attend from each place.
As usual, you are responsible for your own travel and accommodation costs, as well as dinner, but the host will provide a venue, and typically some food/snacks during the event. 

SiREN meetings last lunch to lunch to facilitate travel the same days.
We’ve prepared a choodle (Chalmers Doodle) to collect availability ranges of two days in May and June. 

For access to the choodle, contact your node representative here: https://sirensweden.github.io/#node-representatives or send an email to Jennifer Horkoff jenho@chalmers.se if your university don't yet have a Siren node representative.

Please feel free to invole any other colleagues (students, faculty, industry) who work with RE and may be interested to attend.
 
Given Easter, please fill out the Choodle by April 25th.   Please fill it in with “can’t attend” if you can’t attend.  When we pick a date, we’ll send another call for presentations, priority to students.  This is a great opportunity to informally present your RE-related work to a friendly audience, getting feedback and having discussions.
 
All the best,

Jennifer (and Eric)
