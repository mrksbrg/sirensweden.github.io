## How to build

If you add or modify .md files under src/, you must regenerate the corresponding HTML files using a recent version of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

Navigate to project root and run the bash script `build.sh` 

For running the build script, you need Bash support. If you're using a Mac or Linux, you can use
the built-in terminal. If you're on Windows, you can use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem
for Linux) to run the build script. 

For live preview of your changes in vscode you can use [Live Serve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) runs a minimal web server and opens your default browser to view the HTML files. It also supports hot reloading.
